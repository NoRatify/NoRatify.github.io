        <p class="u-text u-text-default-xs u-text-2"> This is the big one. We’ve been told that “most Postdocs will receive a 20-23% salary increase” by October 2023. This is misleading. Here’s why:</p>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-default-xs u-text-3">
          <li> The “20-23% salary increase” estimate combines <span style="font-style: italic;">step increases</span>, based on experience, with overall <span style="font-style: italic;">scale increases</span>, meant to offset inflation and cost of living
          </li>
          <li> The initial scale increases–which represent the true “growth” in our pay scale–will be instituted in two phases: ~8% in April and ~8% in October, for a total of ~16% by October 2023. Subsequent scale increases will be only 3.7% per year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default-xs u-text-4"> When we look at the scale increases, accounting for inflation, <span style="font-weight: 700;">the current proposed pay scale constitutes a pay cut for Postdocs:</span>

        <ul class="u-text u-text-7">
          <li> If inflation in 2023 remains steady, the proposed initial 16% increase from our current pay scale over the year-long phase-in period constitutes at best, wage stagnation, and at worst, a pay cut<br>
          </li>
          <li> Following this initial phase-in period, scale increases will be 3.5% per year, far below the current rate of inflation</li>

          <li> Locks us into this pay scale for 4.5 years with no way to negotiate COLA or improved raises should our pay continue to lag behind inflation and cost of living in CA</li>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default-xs u-text-10"> This pay scale not only fails to make up for the effective wage decreases we’ve seen over the past several years due to our previous contract not keeping up with inflation, it continues to exacerbate the problem with scale increases below the current rate of inflation.<br>
          <br>The result is that the proposed scale constitutes a pay cut for all Postdocs that gets progressively worse over the course of the contract.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The TA includes a childcare subsidy that starts at $2,500 per YEAR.

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> While we don’t know where the graduate student unions will land, we can be fairly certain that whatever contract we accept will be used as a wage cap and comparison. This would make it extremely difficult for the grad students to get anywhere near their current demands.<br>
          <br>Additionally, the TA&nbsp; includes a “No Strike” clause that would go into effect immediately upon ratification. While Not Strike clauses are standard in union contracts, the timing of our planned ratification vote means that ours could go into effect while Grad students are still bargaining, meaning that we could not continue our strike in solidarity.
        </p>
        <h3 class="u-text u-text-3">What can I do about it?</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4"> While the bargaining team has been working hard to negotiate a contract with the UC, it is ultimately up to us, the members of the union, to decide whether or not the TA represents a contract that works for us.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>If it doesn't, we have the right to vote NO and refuse to ratify the current TA.<br>
          <br>Here is a handy flowchart of questions to consider as you decide how to vote:<br>
          <br>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-5">What happens if I vote NO?</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6"> Refusing to ratify the TA would send a strong message to the UC that <span style="font-weight: 700;">this offer isn’t good enough</span>.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>If greater than 50% of voting Postdocs vote NO on this TA, the UAW and the UC will have to return to the bargaining table with the 2018 contract as the baseline. In the meantime, the strike would continue.<br>
          <br>From there, a few different things could happen:<br>
        </p>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-7">
          <li> The current UAW Bargaining Team (BT) and the UC could negotiate an improved TA, which would then be returned to us for a vote</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="u-custom-list u-text u-text-8">
          <li>
            <div class="u-list-icon">
              <div>○</div>
            </div> It is also possible that some or all of the current BT would resign, and a new BT would be elected to continue negotiations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-9">
          <li>The UC could attempt to declare an impasse</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="u-custom-list u-text u-text-10">
          <li>
            <div class="u-list-icon">
              <div>○</div>
            </div> It is unclear whether this would be possible. In order to declare an impasse, PERB has to agree that <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/bargaining-in-good-faith-with-employees-union-representative" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">both parties have been bargaining in good faith</a>. The outstanding Requests for Information (RFI) and Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) complaints the UAW has against the UC could block the UC from being able to take this path
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-11">
          <li>Should an impasse be declared, there are two possible routes:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="u-custom-list u-text u-text-12">
          <li>
            <div class="u-list-icon">
              <div>○</div>
            </div>The UC unilaterally applies the contract. If they do this, they cannot go any lower than their final offer (meaning the current TA)
          </li>
          <li>
            <div class="u-list-icon">
              <div>○</div>
            </div>A third party could be brought in to arbitrate the contract. The outstanding ULPs and RFIs could give the UAW additional leverage in this situation.

        <ul class="u-text u-text-15">
          <li> Sends a clear message that the proposed Tentative Agreement is not acceptable, and that the UC has to do better</li>

        <ul class="u-text u-text-17">
          <li> Could extend the length of strike</li>
          <li>Delays beginning of new contract</li>
