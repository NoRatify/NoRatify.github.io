        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> While we don’t know where the graduate student unions will land, we can be fairly certain that whatever contract we accept will be used as a wage cap and comparison. This would make it extremely difficult for the grad students to get anywhere near their current demands.<br>
          <br> Additionally, the TA&nbsp; includes a “No Strike” clause that would go into effect immediately upon ratification. While “No Strike” clauses are standard in union contracts, the timing of our planned ratification vote means that ours could go into effect while Grad students are still bargaining, meaning that we could not continue our strike in solidarity. This undermines the original strategy of our strike, which was that all 4 units gain power from striking together. The duration of each unit’s contract is such that it will be very unlikely for us all to be out of contract again at the same time, making this a unique opportunity to bargain while supported by the power of all 4 units striking.<br>

          <br> If greater than 50% of voting Postdocs vote NO on this TA, the UAW and the UC will have to return to the bargaining table.

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">What Happens After a NO vote?<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">After a NO vote, there are a few possible eventualities we can plan for. Which path we end up on depends on a number of factors. Here are the possibilities:</span>

        <ul class="u-text u-text-4">

          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> This is very unlikely.</span> For one thing, UC would know that this offer wouldn’t be good enough to ratify. For another, the UC walking back offers already on the table could strengthen our ULPs (Unfair Labor Practices), and UC has a bad track record with committing ULPs during bargaining. Most PERB (board that administers labor relations laws in CA) decisions have gone against UC and in favor of unions.&nbsp;

        <p class="u-text u-text-16">Would we still be on strike?<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three ways to end a union-sanctioned strike:&nbsp;</span>
          <br>
        </p>
        <ol class="u-text u-text-17">
          <li> Ratify a contract</li>
          <li> Rank and file votes to end strike</li>
          <li> A mandate is issued by the international executive board of UAW to end the strike</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="u-text u-text-18"> This means that it is possible we would continue the strike, or that we would pause the strike to rework bylaws and/or elect a new bargaining team. Exactly how this proceeds depends partly on what next steps the UAW chooses to take, and what we, as rank and file members, decide. If did vote to end the strike, as long as we are not under contract, we could later vote to go on strike again to maximize power at the bargaining table.<br>
          <br>The most important thing bargaining after a NO vote is that we unite again as one union to try to get the best contract possible for everyone. We all have the same goal! Let’s get as much as possible from UC.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-19">What are the Upsides of Voting No?</p>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-20">
          <li> Sends a clear message that the proposed Tentative Agreement is not acceptable, and that the UC has to do better</li>
          <li>Gives the Bargaining Team additional leverage to push back on UC: it shows that the members they represent will not accept that particular contract</li>
          <li> Capitalizes on the momentum of the moment and the scale of the 4-unit strike to push for real gains</li>
          <li> Provides an opportunity to change the bargaining process to one that is more democratic and inclusive</li>

          <li> Could extend the length of strike</li>
          <li>Delays beginning of new contract</li>
          <li>Opens up new routes for how the bargaining will proceed, which could potentially be ​lengthy, less straightforward, or convoluted]</li>
          <li>Once a TA has been rejected, articles that have been TA’ed can be reopened and bargained over again WITHOUT it being considered regressive bargaining. However, it is highly unlikely that we end up in a worse place (see above points on “What Happens After A NO Vote?”)<br>
